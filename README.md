# Sentiment-Analysis

## Problem
Collecting customer feedback is a great way for businesses to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their products and services; At the same time, quickly grasp the mind and needs of customers to bring them the most perfect products and services. Machine Learning has revolutionized the way people solve these problems by bringing tools that allowed companies to analyze people's reviews sentiments with highly reliable results. We use Data analytic tools and Data visualizations techniques have tried to provide eventful insights into data set. And general findings from data sets have been used by machine learning process to generate a prediction on the rating on Foody based on people's criticism.

By analysing the rating on Foody based on people's reviews, the target of this project is building an optimal model that can classify each review into 2 classes of Rating: 1(Positive) and 0(Negative).

## Usage

```bash
# initialize develop environment
conda create env -n sentiment python=3.7

# install dependencies

```
First run `dataset_preprocessing.ipynb` to get the preprocessing data set

Then work around with the `model_training.ipynb` to see what models do
